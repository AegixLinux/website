## Take a screenshot

Use `Shift + PrtSc` to get a menu of screenshot options. 

You can choose to take a shot of whatever you select, the current window, or the entire screen. You can also choose where or not the screenshot is saved as a file to your home directory or copied to your clipboard. The program used to take screenshots is called `maim`.

## View screenshots

Open a terminal with `Ultra + Enter` and type `sxiv .` to view all the images in your home directory where screenshots are saved by default.

<!-- ## Automating saved screenshots to move to `~/ss` -->

<!--You can install cronie to run a cron service that will automatically move screenshots to `~/ss` every 5 minutes. -->
