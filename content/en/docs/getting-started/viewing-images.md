## Viewing Images with `sxiv`

You can view images in the terminal with `sxiv`. Just open a terminal and run:

``` shell
sxiv /path/to/image
```

You can also view multiple images at once:

``` shell
cd /path/to/images
sxiv .
```

When viewing multiple images, you can use the arrow keys to navigate between images. You can also press `Enter` to toggle between full screen and thumbnail view.
