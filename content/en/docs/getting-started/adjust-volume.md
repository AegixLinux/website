### Adjust Audio Volume

Use `Ultra + =` to increase the volume and `Ultra + -` to decrease the volume. Use `Ultra + Shift + M` to mute/unmute the volume.

You may also use the key binding `Ultra + F4` to launch an instance of a terminal-based audio mixer called `pulsemixer`. This is useful for adjusting the volume of individual applications.
