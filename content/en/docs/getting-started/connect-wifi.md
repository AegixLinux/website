## Connect to wifi

Click on the right side of the top bar to launch `NetworkManager TUI`. Use the arrow keys to select `Activate a connection`. Hit Enter. Use the arrow keys to select your wifi network, then press `Enter` to connect. After entering the network password, hit Enter.

Of course you can manage wired connections from here as well. There are status icons in the top right of the top bar for both wired and wireless connections.
