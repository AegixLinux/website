## Don't trust third parties with your secrets

When you use a third-party service to store your data or secrets, you are trusting them to keep it safe. 

### TNO

Trust No One (TNO) is a principle that is often cited in the context of cryptography. 
Everyday computer users can benefit from this principle by using real encryption they control to protect their data.

When we say "real encryption" we mean the kind that bothers state-sponsored hackers.

__For starters, let's consider two very common needs:__
1. A place to store passwords / passphrases 
    - See [PASS](/docs/privacy/pass/)
        - This is a simple password manager that uses real encryption to encrypt and store passwords locally.
2. A place to store private notes 
    - See [Cyphertext Alcove](/docs/privacy/cyphertext-alcove/)
        - This is a simple note manager that uses real encryption to encrypt and store notes (or any files) locally.
