## Don't trust third parties with your secrets

When you use a third-party service to store your data or secrets, you are trusting them to keep it safe. 

### TNO

Trust No One (TNO) is a principle that is often cited in the context of cryptography. 
Everyday computer users can benefit from this principle by using real encryption they control to protect their data.

__For starters, let's consider two very common needs:__
1. A place to store passwords / passphrases
2. A place to store private notes

### Passwords / Passphrases

There are many password managers available that provide the convenience of storing your passwords in the cloud such that you can access them from any device. 
The problem is that you are trusting a third party when you don't need to, not to mention that simply accessing secrets from a mobile device drastically increases your attack surface. 
In case it isn't obvious, state-sponsored hackers aggressively target not only these cloud platforms but also all of the popular mobile devices that access them.
