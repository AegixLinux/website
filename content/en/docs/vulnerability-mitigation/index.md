## XZ Vulnerability Mitigation

Hey.. so xz vulnerability is a real thing. 

---

Run this in your terminal to check version: 

`xz --version`

5.6.0 and 5.6.1 are vulnerable

On an arch-based system like Artix (or Aegix) , look for a prior installed version like this:

`ls /var/cache/pacman/pkg/xz-*`

 Then downgrade like this: 

`pacman -U /var/cache/pacman/pkg/xz-5.4.6-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst`

Then check your version again.

This is the most legit open source backdoor I've ever seen..
