## What is SSH?

SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol that allows you to connect to other machines on your network or out on the internet. It's a secure way to connect to other machines and perform tasks remotely.

## Generate an SSH key pair

To connect to other machines using SSH, you'll need to generate an SSH key pair. You can do this using the `ssh-keygen` command. 

## Copy your public key to the remote machine

Once you've generated your SSH key pair, you'll need to copy your public key to the remote machine. You can do this using the `ssh-copy-id` command.
