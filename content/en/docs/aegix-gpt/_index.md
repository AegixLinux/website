## Custom GPT just for Aegix Linux

There is a Custom GPT just for Aegix called **Aegix Expert**. If you have a plus membership, you can check it out [here, if interested](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-KW4pWi5r5-aegix-expert). 

It's trained on Aegix docs, and it's pretty decent at answering relevant Aegix-related questions.
