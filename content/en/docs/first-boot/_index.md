## Congratulations!

You've just installed Aegix Linux. Congratulations! Now what?

Press `Ultra + F1` to read the built-in documentation of how to get around the system. 

You may be wondering where the `Ultra` key is on your keyboard. It's the same thing that is sometimes referred to as the `Super` key or the `Windows` key. It's usually the one with the Windows logo on it. However on the chromebooks we've tested, it's the `Search` key, with a magnifying glass image printed on it, by default.
